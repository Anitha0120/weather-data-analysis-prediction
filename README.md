# weather-data-analysis-prediction
This project analyzes historical weather data and predicts future temperature trends using time series analysis and machine learning regression models.

 # Project Overview

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on weather data
- Engineer relevant features like lags, rolling stats, and date-based variables
- Train regression models to predict future temperatures
- Evaluate performance using MAE and RMSE
- Visualize trends and predictions
- Built for internship portfolio and demonstration purposes
